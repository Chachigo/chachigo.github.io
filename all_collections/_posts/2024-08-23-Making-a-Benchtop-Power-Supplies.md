## üéØGoal
For a long time now, I wanted a lab power supply to power prototypes and help me repair electronics devices, but pre-builts I found were either too expensive for my usage or not portable. So my DIY power supply must meet personal requirements.

#### üìãRequirements:
- Being portable
- Being powered by the same cable as my soldering iron
- Have a current limiter
- Easy to use
- Cheap

## üîç Identify The Right Parts
To meet the need to be inexpensive, I mostly search on Aliexpress for the different parts of the power supply.
For the main part of the power supply, I'll use this [SK35H 35W buck boost converter](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005007004741793.html) (10.34‚Ç¨).
To power it, I'll use this [USB C to DC5525](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005004744935148.html) (3.11‚Ç¨) that I already use to power my TS100 soldering iron. Since it uses the PowerDelivery protocol, it outputs a 12V 36W current which is perfect for the power supply.
On the power supply side, I'll use these [DC5525 sockets](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005007211080553.html) (2.24‚Ç¨ for 10pcs).
To connect standard 4mm banana cables, I bought this [pack of 30 banana sockets on Amazon](https://amzn.to/3ANy3q4) (11‚Ç¨)(it can be useful in the future). On Amazon, I also bought these [regulation modules](https://amzn.to/4g0DeDh) (13‚Ç¨ for 10pcs) to power a 5V fan (its dimensions are 30x30x10mm) from the 12V of the power input (I used one from an old Raspberry Pi, so I don't have a link for it).

## üõ†Ô∏è Building a Case
Since I don't want to move a bunch of wires, I've designed a case with Fusion 360.
