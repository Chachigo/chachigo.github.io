I buy a lot of stuff from internet so i got a lot of cardboard, and i'm currently testing and sorting a lot of 18650 batteries for another project and i need binns to organize myself correctly.

I'm in an association that have a laser cuter (and i'm planning to buy one) so the goal of my project is to make a cad file where i enter parameters such as: height,width,depth and it make a file use by the lasercutting software and it makes me my foldable cardboard.

The first dificulty was to find the cad software that let me do it, i've previously only used Fusion 360 but the parametric fonctionality that let me use variable is not in the free version and paying 1200â‚¬ per year just for this is not in my plan, i've seach a bit an freecad have this functionality.

after following some youtube tutorials i was able to use this functionality to make my cuttable template (but i this point i still doesn't know how to make 3d model).
